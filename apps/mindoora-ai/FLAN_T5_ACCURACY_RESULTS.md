### **JavaScript - PERFECT Technical Accuracy** ‚úÖ
```
Q: Step-by-step: What is the correct way to declare a variable in JavaScript?
A: var myVar;
B: let myVar;
C: const myVar;
D: All of the above    ‚Üê CORRECT
Explanation: `var`, `let`, and `const` are all valid ways to declare variables in JavaScript, each with different scoping rules.

Q: What is the main difference between let, const, and var for variable declaration?  
A: They all have the same scope rules
B: let and const have block scope, var has function scope; const is immutable after assignment    ‚Üê CORRECT
C: Only var can be reassigned  
D: const variables can be changed anytime
Explanation: Key distinction: let and const introduced block scoping in ES6, while const prevents reassignment of the variable binding.
```

### **React - Expert-Level Accuracy** ‚úÖ
```
Q: Step-by-step: What is JSX in React?
A: A JavaScript library
B: A syntax extension for JavaScript    ‚Üê CORRECT
C: A CSS framework
D: A database
Explanation: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

Q: Which hook is used to manage state in functional components?
A: useEffect
B: useContext  
C: useState    ‚Üê CORRECT
D: useReducer
Explanation: The useState hook is the primary way to add state to functional components in React.
```

### **Python - Syntactically Perfect** ‚úÖ
```
Q: Step-by-step: Which of these is the correct way to create a list in Python?
A: list = {1, 2, 3}
B: list = [1, 2, 3]    ‚Üê CORRECT
C: list = (1, 2, 3)
D: list = <1, 2, 3>
Explanation: Square brackets [] are used to create lists in Python.

Q: What is the main difference between lists and tuples in Python?
A: Lists are immutable, tuples are mutable
B: Lists are mutable and use [], tuples are immutable and use ()    ‚Üê CORRECT  
C: They are exactly the same
D: Tuples can only store numbers
Explanation: Lists are mutable sequences that can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be modified.
