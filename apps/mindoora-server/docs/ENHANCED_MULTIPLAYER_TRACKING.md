# Enhanced Multiplayer Game Tracking System

## üéØ Overview

Your Mindoora quiz game now has a comprehensive enhanced multiplayer tracking system that automatically records detailed game data, determines winners based on speed and accuracy, and provides real-time analytics. All data is automatically captured when players participate in multiplayer games.

## üóÑÔ∏è New Database Tables

### 1. `GameSessions` 
Tracks individual game instances with metadata
- `id`, `roomId`, `gameId`
- `sessionStartedAt`, `sessionEndedAt` 
- `totalQuestions`, `totalPlayers`
- `currentQuestionIndex`, `status`, `gameMode`
- `maxPlayersAllowed`, `sessionMetadata`

### 2. `PlayerPerformance`
Comprehensive player performance tracking per session
- `sessionId`, `playerId`
- `totalPoints`, `correctAnswers`, `incorrectAnswers`
- `questionsAttempted`, `averageReactionTime`
- `fastestCorrectAnswer`, `slowestCorrectAnswer`
- `streak`, `maxStreak`, `rank`
- `pointsFromSpeed`, `pointsFromAccuracy`

### 3. `QuestionAttempts`
Detailed question-level analytics with precise timing
- `sessionId`, `questionId`, `playerId`
- `attemptedAnswer`, `isCorrect`, `timeTakenMs`
- `displayedAt`, `answeredAt`, `timeoutAt`
- `pointsEarned`, `speedRank`, `wasFirstCorrect`

### 4. `LiveLeaderboard`
Real-time leaderboard that updates during games
- `sessionId`, `playerId`, `playerName`
- `currentPoints`, `currentRank`
- `questionsAnswered`, `correctAnswers`, `currentStreak`
- `lastUpdated`

### 5. Enhanced Existing Tables
- **`QuestionsSolved`**: Added `answeredAtMs`, `answerOrder`, `reactionTime`
- **`userGameScore`**: Added `sessionId`, `finalRank`, `completionPercentage`, `speedBonus`, `accuracyBonus`

## üöÄ How It Works

### When a Game Starts:
1. **Game Room Creation**: When `startGameController` is called, it automatically:
   - Creates a new `GameSession` record
   - Initializes `LiveLeaderboard` entries for all players
   - Sets up `PlayerPerformance` tracking

### When Players Answer Questions:
1. **Automatic Data Recording**: The enhanced `createQuestionSolveController` now:
   - Records precise millisecond timestamps (`answeredAtMs`)
   - Automatically assigns answer order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
   - Calculates reaction time in milliseconds
   - Creates `QuestionAttempts` records for detailed analytics
   - Updates `PlayerPerformance` metrics in real-time
   - Updates `LiveLeaderboard` rankings automatically via database triggers

### When a Game Ends:
1. **Winner Calculation**: The `updateGameRoomStatusController` automatically:
   - Calculates final rankings based on multiple criteria
   - Updates `userGameScore` with comprehensive results
   - Updates `GameWinners` table with top 3 players
   - Marks session as completed

## üèÜ Winner Determination Logic

Winners are determined using a comprehensive multi-criteria system:

1. **Primary**: Total Points (including speed bonuses)
2. **Secondary**: Number of Correct Answers
3. **Tertiary**: First Correct Answers (speed bonus)
4. **Quaternary**: Average Reaction Time
5. **Final Tiebreaker**: Accuracy Rate

### Speed Bonuses:
- Answers within 30% of time limit: +50% points
- Answers within 60% of time limit: +20% points
- First correct answer per question: Additional priority in rankings
